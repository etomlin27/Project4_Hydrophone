## Problem Statement:

To understand how plate tectonics produce earthquakes, it is useful to study the intensity of earthquakes in magnitude on the Richter scale and plot them on a map using latitude and longitudinal coordinates. By examining the eearthquakes on plate boundaries, comparisons can be made with the known type of boundary movement; convergent, divergent, or transverse.

## Backround/ Solution/ Results:

Graphical analysis of the earthquake magnitude over time shows how quakes of varying magnitudes occur throughout the year. Figure 1 shows earthquake data over the last decade.

Looking at earthquakes since 2010 on a map reveals the boundaries of the tectonic plates in the area, namely the Juan de Fuca plate, due to the heightened activity along the boundaries. These occur just off the coast of the Pacific Northwest as seen in figure 2. The maximum magnitude earthquake was  6.8  for the area and time since 2010. The minimum magnitude earthquake was  2.5  for the area and time since 2010. The average magnitude of all earthquakes is  3.24  for the area and time since 2010.

Further narrowing the timeline, looking at April of 2015 other plate tectonic effects on earthquakes can be observed. In April 2015 there was an undersea volcanic eruption. As seen in figure 3, there was several larger magnitude earthquakes occuring in this shorter time frame.

Isolating the geographic region examined to compare the differnces in quakes produced by divergent or transformational plate boundaries. Figures 4 and 5 show divergent and transformational earthquakes, respectively. The divergent fault line appears to produce more earthquakes but at a lower magnitude. The divergent faultline statistics are: maximum magnitude earthquake was 6.6, minimum magnitude earthquake was  2.5, average magnitude of all earthquakes is  2.97.

*Figure 5: Earthquakes along the Transverse Plate Boundary.*

For the transverse boundary: the maximum magnitude earthquake was  5.6  for the area and time since 2010. The minimum magnitude earthquake was  2.5  for the area and time since 2010. The average magnitude of all earthquakes is  3.41  for the area and time since 2010.

## Conclusion:

Plate movements cause earthquakes as they seperate (diverge), collide and subduct (converge), and slide transversally.
